~Question: Write Binary Search Tree stages of the array

~Solution:

Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:

 1)The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.

 2)The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.

 3)The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
